# Multi-variable AUC for Sifting Complementary Features

It is a demo code for the paper submitted to briefings in bioinformatics, without any code comment. We use the artificial dataset shown in Table.1 as the input of the algorithm.
 
Two contributions for mvAUC:
1. Globally evaluate the complementarity among features.
2. Screen discriminative combination of features that are complementary to each other from global view by using developed feature selection algorithm.

Note: features means genes when apply to gene expression datasets.
